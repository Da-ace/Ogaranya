    question: "Phone Number Verification",
    answer: `Our Phone Number Verification service helps businesses to verify that a phone number is active. We believe our approach is a better alternative to sending OTP to users' phone numbers.


    Our approach is to have your users send a pre-setup token to a dedicated number, after which we will send to your server all the information of the user who sent this token to our server for validation. This saves you the rigor of wasting your SMS units by sending them to a vicious user who is just trying to test your application. Our approach will also cut off users who would not get your OTP due to DND (Do-Not-Disturb) restrictions.`,
